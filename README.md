## Project Instructions

For this project, a static webpage was given that lacks accessibility for screen readers and responsiveness for different sized displays. A service worker will be employed to create an offline experience and accessibility and responsive features will be added. 

1. Clone or download the repository at: (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

2. In this folder, start a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

    In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

4. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

5. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) in the main.js and restaurant_info.js files. Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
